#Hey veronica
# i hope you are well
#you need to run this file and record for each person
#make sure that person knows that he need to make his voice very clear and loud in the mic
#make sure to tell the person to listen to what he is listening to
#in case you find any yerrors like " i can not find the class caled recorder"
#change first line to from recorder import SoundRecorder
#in case you are running from Linux, a error will occur
# open recorder file
#the problem is that in windows you need to have any directory with \\ while in linux mafrood ykoon fi one slash bs
#yemkn dh tkoon el moshkla lw you run in ubunutu
# try kda os.path.normpath(path) 3ala el path el gowa recorder
#or sheel el 2 slasha to 1 slash in  python
#probability the problem will be in line 15 and line 16
